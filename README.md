# any_of

A Dart package that provides utility classes for working with discriminated unions known as "any-of" types. These types allow you to represent a value that can be one of several possible options.

## Overview

The `any_of` package simplifies working with any-of types in your Dart applications. It provides the following classes:

- `Doublet`: Represents a pair of values where one of the values is selected.
- `Triplet`: Represents a triplet of values where one of the values is selected.
- `Quartet`: ---
- ... Up to `Nonet`

These classes provide convenient methods for mapping, handling different cases, and ensuring the presence of a value.

## Installation

To use this package, add `any_of` as a dependency in your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  any_of: <latest>
```

# Usage

## Importing the package

```yaml
import 'package:any_of/any_of.dart';
```

## Doublet Usage

A Doublet represents a pair of values where one value is selected. Here's an example of how to create and work with a Doublet:

```dart

class TestDoubletClass extends Doublet<String, NotFound> {
  TestDoubletClass.success(super.value) : super.first();
  TestDoubletClass.notFound(super.value) : super.second();
}

// or

class TestDoubletClass extends Doublet<String, NotFound> {
  TestDoubletClass.success(String value) : super.first(value);
  TestDoubletClass.notFound(NotFound value) : super.second(value);
}

// or

class TestDoubletClass extends Doublet<String, NotFound> {
  TestDoubletClass.success() : super.first('Default String');
  TestDoubletClass.notFound(NotFound value) : super.second(value);
}

void main() {
  var response = TestDoubletClass.success('Success');

  if (response.isFirst) {
    print(response.first);  // Output: 'Success'
  } else if (response.isSecond) {
    print(response.second); // Is not executed
  }
}
```

# API Reference

## `Doublet` Class

A class that represents a pair of values where one of the values is selected.

### Constructors

- `Doublet.first(T0 value)`: Constructs a Doublet instance with the first value selected.
- `Doublet.second(T1 value)`: Constructs a Doublet instance with the second value selected.

### Properties

- `isFirst`: Returns true if the first value is selected, otherwise false.
- `isSecond`: Returns true if the second value is selected, otherwise false.
- `first`: Returns the first value. Throws a TypeError if the first value is not selected.
- `second`: Returns the second value. Throws a TypeError if the second value is not selected.
- `props`: A list of the first and second values.

### Methods

- `map<R>({required R Function(T0) first, required R Function(T1) second})`: Applies a mapping function to the selected value and returns the result. Throws an Exception if no value is selected.
- `on<R>({required void Function(T0) first, required void Function(T1) second})`: Executes a callback function based on the selected value. Throws an Exception if no value is selected.
- `ifType<R>({required void Function(R) callback})`: Executes a callback function if the selected value matches the specified type. Does nothing if no value is selected or if the selected value does not match the type.

## `Triplet` class

The same Constructors, Properties and Methods on `Doublet` are applied to `Triplet`, but with an extra value. This is equivalent up until `Nonet`.

The classes are:

- Doublet
- Triplet
- Quartet
- Quintet
- Sextet
- Septet
- Octet
- Nonet

## Built-In response types

As most applications share the same errors, there are some built-in response types you can use as an indicator what went wrong. Right now there are:

- ApiError
- BadRequest
- Conflict
- InternalError
- NetworkError
- NotFound
- NotImplemented
- PermissionDenied
- SerializationError
- ServiceUnavailable
- Success
- TimedOut
- Unauthorized
- UnknownError
- ValidationFailed

But you can return any type as response, such as `bool`, `String`, `int`, etc. or any other custom class. The above response types extend from [AnyOfType] but this is not a must.
